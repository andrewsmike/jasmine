Jasmine ETL: Jasmine's ETL platform.
====================================
Jasmine Web interacts with clients' databases to collect metadata, manage schema, and perform ETL operations.
Jasmine ETL provides a worker pool for launching one-off jobs (like scanning metadata, upgrading schema, migrating data, etc) and running persistent, scheduled jobs (such as regular ETLs).
